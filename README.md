# Custom Countries and States (with or without areas) For WooCommerce
- By Francis Ihejirika

Hi there, this repository contains codes for a custom wordpress plugin to enable you either create new countries and states on WooCommerce (or edit existing ones) and allow you create custom Shipping Zones for them. Creating Custom Shipping Zones will permit you to specify different prices for delivery (either flat rate, free shipping or local pickup).

You may want to check out the sample WordPress plugin created for Lagos, Nigeria and the specific areas within.



## About The Plugin/Codes

The plugin, when edited to your specification, allows you to also mention specific areas you may want to cover for delivery.

To edit the plugin to your specification, you need to download the repo as a ZIP file, and navigate to the "woo-custom-country-states.php" file

There are clear comments to guide you to edit to your specification



## Dependencies

The plugin requires WooCommerce to be installed and active to function properly.

Edits to the shipping amount can be made by navigating to WooCommerce > Settings > Shipping

You can specify your shipping details as you desire.



## Extra Info

The first section of the code contains a block that prevents sending of malicious requests to your website if the request is not a verified admin user.
You can decide to remove the block of code if you have a protected WordPress site using Jetpack, Wordfence or other security plugins.
